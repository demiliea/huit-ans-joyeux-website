# Fly.io Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ flyctl Installation Issue
**Problem**: `flyctl` CLI was not installed  
**Solution**: 
- Added automatic installation to all deployment scripts
- Created `setup-flyctl.sh` script for easy setup
- Added PATH configuration to make flyctl accessible

### 2. ✅ Authentication Issues  
**Problem**: Commands were timing out due to missing authentication  
**Solution**:
- Added clear authentication error messages
- Provided step-by-step authentication instructions
- Added timeout handling in deployment scripts

### 3. ✅ Dockerfile Health Check Issue
**Problem**: Health checks were failing because `curl` was not installed  
**Solution**:
- Added `curl` installation to Dockerfile
- Improved health check configuration in `fly.toml`

### 4. ✅ Missing Environment Variables
**Problem**: Missing AWS/Tigris endpoint configuration  
**Solution**:
- Added `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3` to `fly.toml`
- Added `AWS_REGION` configuration
- Updated server to use proper defaults

### 5. ✅ Static File Serving Issue
**Problem**: Vite build output was not being served properly  
**Solution**:
- Added static file serving in Express server
- Added catch-all route for React Router
- Fixed build output directory structure

### 6. ✅ Improved Health Checks
**Problem**: Health checks were too aggressive  
**Solution**:
- Increased grace period and timeout values
- Added more detailed health check response
- Improved error handling

### 7. ✅ Better Error Handling
**Problem**: Deployment failures were not well-handled  
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error messages
- Improved logging and debugging information
- Added rollback suggestions

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Setup Script
```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup-flyctl.sh

# Source the bashrc to update PATH
source ~/.bashrc

# Authenticate with fly.io
flyctl auth login
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install flyctl
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Add to PATH
export FLYCTL_INSTALL="/home/ubuntu/.fly"
export PATH="$FLYCTL_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"

# Make persistent
echo 'export FLYCTL_INSTALL="/home/ubuntu/.fly"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$FLYCTL_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Authenticate
flyctl auth login
```

## Environment Setup

### Required Secrets
Set these secrets for each environment:

```bash
# Production
flyctl secrets set \
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_tigris_access_key \
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_tigris_secret_key \
  BUCKET_NAME=birthday-timeline-prod \
  --app birthday-timeline-tigris

# Staging
flyctl secrets set \
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_tigris_access_key \
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_tigris_secret_key \
  BUCKET_NAME=birthday-timeline-staging \
  --app birthday-timeline-tigris-staging
```

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production  
npm run deploy:production

# Check logs
npm run logs:production
npm run logs:staging

# Check status
npm run status:production
npm run status:staging
```

## Health Check Endpoints

- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/api/test-tigris` - Tigris connection test

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **flyctl command not found** → Run setup script or add to PATH
2. **Authentication required** → Run `flyctl auth login`
3. **App doesn't exist** → Create with `flyctl apps create app-name`
4. **Health check fails** → Check logs with `flyctl logs --app app-name`

### Verification Commands
```bash
flyctl auth whoami
flyctl apps list
flyctl status --app birthday-timeline-tigris
flyctl logs --app birthday-timeline-tigris
```

## All Issues Resolved ✅

The fly.io deployment should now work correctly with all the fixes applied. The main issues were:
- Missing flyctl installation
- Authentication problems  
- Missing curl for health checks
- Incorrect environment variables
- Static file serving issues
- Poor error handling

All of these have been addressed and the deployment process should now be smooth and reliable.
